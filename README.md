Final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures class of 2015/2. This project was a collaboration between André Antonitsch and Rafael Copstein.

This project was split into two parts:

	1 - Creating a graph that could perform the basic operations (insertion and removal) in O(1) time
	
	2 - Creating a visual testbed for famous graph algorithms using the previously developed graph implementation
	
Our solution is based on the code for [Violet](http://horstmann.com/violet/) by Cay Horstmann which was modified specifically for this assignment by [Prof. Júlio Machado](http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~juliopm/).

This repository is a netbeans project.
